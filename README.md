# ColumnsView
Plugin for Unity. Provides column view for Project and Hierarchy windows

Install: Download, unzip and place root folder (ColumnsView-master) or clone repository under Assets folder of Unity Project.

Functionality (Minimal right now):
<ul>
<li>Basic columns view window for Project view implementation</li>
<li>Creation of C# script with basic template</li>
<li>Open and Delete of items with context menu (Double click for opening as well).</li>
<li>Renaming and Moving files and folders needs more testing and polishing</li>
<li>Context menu for Project Columns window (only a few items have functionality right now).</li>
</ul>

Note: For creation of C# script files. Plugin assumes its root folder it is directly under Assets folder to access the Script Templates folder. This can be changed in ScriptTemplates.cs if you wish to change the location.
